# Using shadow DOM with Vue 3.x components

This example shows how to use shadow DOM for CSS isolation directly with Vue components. It uses [vue-shadow-root](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-shadow-dom) package to manage shadow DOM (for simplicty).

## Getting started

To start the project run the following command:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

and navigate to http://localhost:2998

## Reason for using shadow DOM

Shadow DOM allows hidden DOM trees to be attached to elements in the regular DOM tree â€” this shadow DOM tree starts with a shadow root, underneath which you can attach any element.

Shadow DOM provides three benefits:

- DOM scoping. DOM APIs like document.querySelector won't find elements in the component's shadow DOM, so it's harder for global scripts to accidentally break your component.

- Style scoping. You can write encapsulated styles for your shadow DOM that don't affect the rest of the DOM tree.

- Composition. The component's shadow root, which contains its internal DOM, is separate from the component's children. You can choose how children are rendered in your component's internal DOM.
